  Parameters: {"_form_key"=>"be83e27fcb4b1c3d22ba8f19c34ccd1b2eab3d7e", "content"=>"Executive summary\r\n=================\r\n\r\nWeek starting **Saturday July 7 2012** ending **Friday July 13 2012**\r\n\r\nReport generated in week 29, 2012.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPAC\r\n====\r\n\r\n#### BNE ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1. Deployment of Beacon and Newspaper is currently blocked. The hardware has arrived, yet an audit of the existing infrastructure revealed that it was under utilized. Plan for reorganizing this infrastructure has been completed and work on setting up the hardware has begun. It is expected to be completed over the next week.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops pricing model draft has been completed by ggillies. After further review and clarification it is hoped that this will form a basis for Engineering Operations to secure more funding for future growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Start Eng-Ops project pipeline. In particular, work on the Mirror Manager project will begin by mgrigull.\r\n\r\n+ Deployment of Gerrit staging environment. This will be done by ggillies and once completed will allow Eng-Ops to move ahead with a production deployment. This is ongoing to due to packaging issues which have delayed work.\r\n\r\n+ Evaluation of Jenkins as a continuous integration tool. This work will be completed by ggillies, weizhang, zdou and huili. Once the evaluation is complete it will allow Eng-Ops to move ahead with a production deployment.\r\n\r\n+ Provision of new documentation staging servers to accommodate the mass rebuild of all Red Hat documentation as part of the Publican 3.0 rollout. This is expected to finish next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### NAY ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1.The NAY facility requires cabling and cable settings for five (5) cages worth of hardware (for FY13 purchasing which is onging). Wei Zhang has planned the drawing and contacted the vendor for quotes. The vendor has still not gotten back to us regarding the quote, Eng-Ops is proceeding to chase them up. Failure to resolve this will impact the roll out of systems for Beaker (Kernel QE and Virt QE) as well as tools development work in NAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ NAY Sysadmins have continued to be trained in setting up production systems for Eng-Ops tools. This will ease the workload on the Eng-Ops APAC team and allowing them to focus on higher level tasks.\r\n\r\n+ Treasury stage was set up for devel use. This task was completed on schedule, and will allow development and Eng-Ops to test deployments of Treasury before moving to production.\r\n\r\n+ TCMS was updated for user privilege issues. Some Test Cases contents were missing which blocked QE testing. When a Test Case was deleted by someone with appropriate privileges, many Test Cases were removed. Now, only the specified Test Case will be deleted. Privilege to delete is now restricted. \r\n\r\n+ ZK online spreadsheet was migrated to BOS for further testing and evaluation by management staff. While the online spreadsheet program is currently a pilot, testing in BOS (in particular, for performance) is critical to evaluating the tool's potential long term.\r\n\r\n+ Thinkfree devel was set up for evaluation by llim and HSS management. The Evaluation is expected to last 30 days after which a decision will be made whether or not to put the product into production.\r\n\r\n+ Maitai staging environment was setup. This allows developers and Eng-Ops to test the Maitai product in a fully Eng-Ops controlled environment before moving the tool into production.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Migrate all Virt-QE machines which do not run virtLAB auto test jobs into Beaker. This will continue the process of spinning down virtLAB and allow those hardware resources to be better used in Beaker. The long term the goal is to move all virtLAB hardware into beaker.\r\n\r\n+ Cable and Set up 5 racks for FY13 new hardware. This is to accommodate the FY13 CAPEX purchasing which sees a large influx of new hardware into the NAY lab.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PNQ ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nNone to report this week.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Setting up Globalsync and Eng-Ops core services in BLR. This is the standard Eng-Ops hardware and software suite that is deployed in all engineering labs and provides basic services to engineering staff including RHEL tree mirror, IRC, shell server, and more.\r\n\r\n+ Because of IT decommissioning NIS for user authentication/authorization and moving to LDAP, sll PNQ servers were switched from using NIS to LDAP for their configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Configure DS3512 storage (Install IBM Storage Manager for DS).\r\n\r\n+ Install Operating Systems.\r\n\r\n+ Setup Globalsync/RHCS.\r\n\r\n+ Setup other services as VMs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMEA\r\n====\r\n\r\n#### TLV ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\n#### BRQ ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n==\r\n\r\n#### BOS ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nNone to report this week.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Brought two (2) new Lab Admins up to speed with RT and the Lab environment. This will help address issues caused by our current resource limitations, specifically with the Eng-Ops lab ticket backlog in RT.\r\n\r\n+ Racked up Gluster phase #2 and adjusted cage space in Lab 1 to accommodate new racks for phase #2. This task is on schedule, but, the cables still need to be labeled and run, and the DRACs need to be configured. This project will be completely wrapped up within two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Lab environment monitoring project. The lab monitoring system will be put in place for BOS in the short term. If the system tests well in BOS, the hardware and procedures we utilized will be scaled to global lab environments. The thermal sensors were installed in all three labs this week. We are now beginning the next phase of the project which is to get a software control suite in place to collect and organize the data gathered in the lab. We are currently looking at a couple of different utilities that can perform this function.\r\n\r\n+ Gluster phase #3 order. Physical lab space to be allocated once phase #2 is in place. Cage walls in lab 1 may need removal to fit phase #3 in with the other gluster racks. Servers will arrive, be received, racked, cabled, configured (this task is very resource intensive).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### RDU ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n", "author"=>"mdoyle", "web"=>"engops", "id"=>"IanNeilsen"}

  Parameters: {"_form_key"=>"735055aff87d53d1e84a7ed8872448f1c305b49a", "alter_title"=>"1", "new_name"=>"Engineering Operations Weekly Executive Briefing - Week 29", "content"=>"Executive summary\r\n=================\r\n\r\nWeek starting **Saturday July 7 2012** ending **Friday July 13 2012**\r\n\r\nReport generated in week 29, 2012.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPAC\r\n====\r\n\r\n#### BNE ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1. Deployment of Beacon and Newspaper is currently blocked. The hardware has arrived, yet an audit of the existing infrastructure revealed that it was under utilized. Plan for reorganizing this infrastructure has been completed and work on setting up the hardware has begun. It is expected to be completed over the next week.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops pricing model draft has been completed by ggillies. After further review and clarification it is hoped that this will form a basis for Engineering Operations to secure more funding for future growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Start Eng-Ops project pipeline. In particular, work on the Mirror Manager project will begin by mgrigull.\r\n\r\n+ Deployment of Gerrit staging environment. This will be done by ggillies and once completed will allow Eng-Ops to move ahead with a production deployment. This is ongoing to due to packaging issues which have delayed work.\r\n\r\n+ Evaluation of Jenkins as a continuous integration tool. This work will be completed by ggillies, weizhang, zdou and huili. Once the evaluation is complete it will allow Eng-Ops to move ahead with a production deployment.\r\n\r\n+ Provision of new documentation staging servers to accommodate the mass rebuild of all Red Hat documentation as part of the Publican 3.0 rollout. This is expected to finish next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### NAY ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1.The NAY facility requires cabling and cable settings for five (5) cages worth of hardware (for FY13 purchasing which is onging). Wei Zhang has planned the drawing and contacted the vendor for quotes. The vendor has still not gotten back to us regarding the quote, Eng-Ops is proceeding to chase them up. Failure to resolve this will impact the roll out of systems for Beaker (Kernel QE and Virt QE) as well as tools development work in NAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ NAY Sysadmins have continued to be trained in setting up production systems for Eng-Ops tools. This will ease the workload on the Eng-Ops APAC team and allowing them to focus on higher level tasks.\r\n\r\n+ Treasury stage was set up for devel use. This task was completed on schedule, and will allow development and Eng-Ops to test deployments of Treasury before moving to production.\r\n\r\n+ TCMS was updated for user privilege issues. Some Test Cases contents were missing which blocked QE testing. When a Test Case was deleted by someone with appropriate privileges, many Test Cases were removed. Now, only the specified Test Case will be deleted. Privilege to delete is now restricted. \r\n\r\n+ ZK online spreadsheet was migrated to BOS for further testing and evaluation by management staff. While the online spreadsheet program is currently a pilot, testing in BOS (in particular, for performance) is critical to evaluating the tool's potential long term.\r\n\r\n+ Thinkfree devel was set up for evaluation by llim and HSS management. The Evaluation is expected to last 30 days after which a decision will be made whether or not to put the product into production.\r\n\r\n+ Maitai staging environment was setup. This allows developers and Eng-Ops to test the Maitai product in a fully Eng-Ops controlled environment before moving the tool into production.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Migrate all Virt-QE machines which do not run virtLAB auto test jobs into Beaker. This will continue the process of spinning down virtLAB and allow those hardware resources to be better used in Beaker. The long term the goal is to move all virtLAB hardware into beaker.\r\n\r\n+ Cable and Set up 5 racks for FY13 new hardware. This is to accommodate the FY13 CAPEX purchasing which sees a large influx of new hardware into the NAY lab.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PNQ ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nNone to report this week.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Setting up Globalsync and Eng-Ops core services in BLR. This is the standard Eng-Ops hardware and software suite that is deployed in all engineering labs and provides basic services to engineering staff including RHEL tree mirror, IRC, shell server, and more.\r\n\r\n+ Because of IT decommissioning NIS for user authentication/authorization and moving to LDAP, sll PNQ servers were switched from using NIS to LDAP for their configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Configure DS3512 storage (Install IBM Storage Manager for DS).\r\n\r\n+ Install Operating Systems.\r\n\r\n+ Setup Globalsync/RHCS.\r\n\r\n+ Setup other services as VMs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMEA\r\n====\r\n\r\n#### TLV ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\n#### BRQ ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n==\r\n\r\n#### BOS ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nNone to report this week.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Brought two (2) new Lab Admins up to speed with RT and the Lab environment. This will help address issues caused by our current resource limitations, specifically with the Eng-Ops lab ticket backlog in RT.\r\n\r\n+ Racked up Gluster phase #2 and adjusted cage space in Lab 1 to accommodate new racks for phase #2. This task is on schedule, but, the cables still need to be labeled and run, and the DRACs need to be configured. This project will be completely wrapped up within two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Lab environment monitoring project. The lab monitoring system will be put in place for BOS in the short term. If the system tests well in BOS, the hardware and procedures we utilized will be scaled to global lab environments. The thermal sensors were installed in all three labs this week. We are now beginning the next phase of the project which is to get a software control suite in place to collect and organize the data gathered in the lab. We are currently looking at a couple of different utilities that can perform this function.\r\n\r\n+ Gluster phase #3 order. Physical lab space to be allocated once phase #2 is in place. Cage walls in lab 1 may need removal to fit phase #3 in with the other gluster racks. Servers will arrive, be received, racked, cabled, configured (this task is very resource intensive).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### RDU ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n", "author"=>"mdoyle", "web"=>"engops", "id"=>"IanNeilsen"}

Deployment of Beacon and Newspaper is currently blocked. The hardware has arrived, yet an audit of the existing infrastructure revealed that it was under utilized. Plan for reorganizing this infrastructure has been completed and work on setting up the hardware has begun. It is expected to be completed over the next week.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops pricing model draft has been completed by ggillies. After further review and clarification it is hoped that this will form a basis for Engineering Operations to secure more funding for future growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Start Eng-Ops project pipeline. In particular, work on the Mirror Manager project will begin by mgrigull.\r\n\r\n+ Deployment of Gerrit staging environment. This will be done by ggillies and once completed will allow Eng-Ops to move ahead with a production deployment. This is ongoing to due to packaging issues which have delayed work.\r\n\r\n+ Evaluation of Jenkins as a continuous integration tool. This work will be completed by ggillies, weizhang, zdou and huili. Once the evaluation is complete it will allow Eng-Ops to move ahead with a production deployment.\r\n\r\n+ Provision of new documentation staging servers to accommodate the mass rebuild of all Red Hat documentation as part of the Publican 3.0 rollout. This is expected to finish next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### NAY ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1.The NAY facility requires cabling and cable settings for five (5) cages worth of hardware (for FY13 purchasing which is onging). Wei Zhang has planned the drawing and contacted the vendor for quotes. The vendor has still not gotten back to us regarding the quote, Eng-Ops is proceeding to chase them up. Failure to resolve this will impact the roll out of systems for Beaker (Kernel QE and Virt QE) as well as tools development work in NAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ NAY Sysadmins have continued to be trained in setting up production systems for Eng-Ops tools. This will ease the workload on the Eng-Ops APAC team and allowing them to focus on higher level tasks.\r\n\r\n+ Treasury stage was set up for devel use. This task was completed on schedule, and will allow development and Eng-Ops to test deployments of Treasury before moving to production.\r\n\r\n+ TCMS was updated for user privilege issues. Some Test Cases contents were missing which blocked QE testing. When a Test Case was deleted by someone with appropriate privileges, many Test Cases were removed. Now, only the specified Test Case will be deleted. Privilege to delete is now restricted. \r\n\r\n+ ZK online spreadsheet was migrated to BOS for further testing and evaluation by management staff. While the online spreadsheet program is currently a pilot, testing in BOS (in particular, for performance) is critical to evaluating the tool's potential long term.\r\n\r\n+ Thinkfree devel was set up for evaluation by llim and HSS management. The Evaluation is expected to last 30 days after which a decision will be made whether or not to put the product into production.\r\n\r\n+ Maitai staging environment was setup. This allows developers and Eng-Ops to test the Maitai product in a fully Eng-Ops controlled environment before moving the tool into production.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Migrate all Virt-QE machines which do not run virtLAB auto test jobs into Beaker. This will continue the process of spinning down virtLAB and allow those hardware resources to be better used in Beaker. The long term the goal is to move all virtLAB hardware into beaker.\r\n\r\n+ Cable and Set up 5 racks for FY13 new hardware. This is to accommodate the FY13 CAPEX purchasing which sees a large influx of new hardware into the NAY lab.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PNQ ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nNone to report this week.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Setting up Globalsync and Eng-Ops core services in BLR. This is the standard Eng-Ops hardware and software suite that is deployed in all engineering labs and provides basic services to engineering staff including RHEL tree mirror, IRC, shell server, and more.\r\n\r\n+ Because of IT decommissioning NIS for user authentication/authorization and moving to LDAP, sll PNQ servers were switched from using NIS to LDAP for their configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Configure DS3512 storage (Install IBM Storage Manager for DS).\r\n\r\n+ Install Operating Systems.\r\n\r\n+ Setup Globalsync/RHCS.\r\n\r\n+ Setup other services as VMs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMEA\r\n====\r\n\r\n#### TLV ####\r\n\r\nNo update this week due to PTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### BRQ ####\r\n\r\nNo update this week due to PTO.\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n==\r\n\r\n#### BOS ####\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nNone to report this week.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Brought two (2) new Lab Admins up to speed with RT and the Lab environment. This will help address issues caused by our current resource limitations, specifically with the Eng-Ops lab ticket backlog in RT.\r\n\r\n+ Racked up Gluster phase #2 and adjusted cage space in Lab 1 to accommodate new racks for phase #2. This task is on schedule, but, the cables still need to be labeled and run, and the DRACs need to be configured. This project will be completely wrapped up within two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n+ Lab environment monitoring project. The lab monitoring system will be put in place for BOS in the short term. If the system tests well in BOS, the hardware and procedures we utilized will be scaled to global lab environments. The thermal sensors were installed in all three labs this week. We are now beginning the next phase of the project which is to get a software control suite in place to collect and organize the data gathered in the lab. We are currently looking at a couple of different utilities that can perform this function.\r\n\r\n+ Gluster phase #3 order. Physical lab space to be allocated once phase #2 is in place. Cage walls in lab 1 may need removal to fit phase #3 in with the other gluster racks. Servers will arrive, be received, racked, cabled, configured (this task is very resource intensive).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### RDU ####\r\n\r\nNo update this week.\r\n", "author"=>"mdoyle", "web"=>"engops", "id"=>"Engineering Operations Weekly Executive Briefing - Week 29"}
