=================
 
Testing started **Tuesday Jun 12th 2012** finished **Tuesday June 19th 2012** 

Report for week 25, 2012. 

+ No entitlement related components were changed since RC-2 and all testing passed on RHEL-6.3-RC-2; all RHEL6.3 errata were pushed to REL_PREP. However, one RHEL6.3.z subscription-manager errata is still waiting to be pushed out before 20th June; 

+ RHEL6.3 GA content testing against Mirror CDN (cdn.rcm-internal.redhat.com) failed with two bugs FailedQA; although not blocking RHEL6.3 GA, seven RHEL6.3 deployment guide bugs are waiting to be fixed. 

+ The Team will do RHEL6.3 GA content testing against Production CDN (cdn.redhat.com) and then focus on RHEL5.9 test planning. The plan is to send RHEL5.9 Entitlement IEEE Test Plan draft to Devel/PM to review before 18th July.

Risks/Actions 
-------------- 

1. Need Michael Stead to set filelist and push following subscription-manager 6.3.z errata to QE status ASAP. Without it QE can not push it REL_PREP status.
    
   + [RHBA-2012:13347-01](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/showrequest.cgi?id=13347)  - subscription-manager bug fix update 
   
2. Need J.C. Molet to push the subscription-manager 6.3.z errata to REL_PREP before June 20th.
    
   + [RHBA-2012:13347-01](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/showrequest.cgi?id=13347)  - subscription-manager bug fix update 

3. Need Dennis Gregorovic to fix following two content bugs on Mirror CDN.
        
   + [Bug 833258](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=833258) - Many packages are missing in repomd.xml on Mirror CDN [ASSIGNED, FailedQA]

   + [Bug 833309](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=833309) - No product cert installed after installing package of &quot;High Performance Network&quot; against Mirror CDN [ASSIGNED, FailedQA]

4. Need Content Services team to fix following RHEL6.3 deployment guide bugs. The deployment guide will only be available online, so it should not block RHEL6.3 GA. However, since the deployment guide is cross-referenced in Release Notes which tell customers how to deploy and use subscription-manager, QE expect these bugs to be fixed before RHEL6.3 GA.

   + [Bug 831052](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831052) - Options username and password should be required when registering with consumerid [MODIFIED]

   + [Bug 831064](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831064) - List --installed could not display subscribed but not installed products [MODIFIED]

   + [Bug 831110](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831110) - Change button &quot;Update&quot; to &quot;Auto-subscribe&quot; and change dialog &quot;Subscription Assistant&quot; to &quot;Subscribe System&quot; [MODIFIED]

   + [Bug 831093](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831093) - Redundant step for auto-subscribe during registering should be removed [MODIFIED]

   + [Bug 831120](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831120) - Could not use install-num-migrate-to-rhsm in rhel6 [MODIFIED]

   + [Bug 831131](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831131) - Outputs of config --remove should be the same whether default value exist or not [MODIFIED]

   + [Bug 831182](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831182) - A system can only be in one environment [MODIFIED]
