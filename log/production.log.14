HW replacement for the hypervisors is in place however it takes some time to move the guests over. Most of them have to be moved during the next maintenance window (June 8th). The most critical for now is the storage cluster: hardware replacement for it wasn't even ordered yet (RT# 132548)\r\n\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Dell Ops-util unit (responsible for BOS lab DNS and DHCP) is out of warranty. There are no backup units currently in place and any downtime on this unit will hold up critical BOS lab functions. We have already had to replace a CPU once. Eng-ops currently lacks the resources required to get the Ops-util replacement blades online. what is required to do it?\r\nThe replacement blades for this unit need to be brought online and configured for redundant 'fail safe' operation. We just lost our sr. systems admin in BOS and we don't currently have any sys admins with the experience or available time to start this project. We are looking into alternative solutions that are less resource intensive.\r\n\r\n+ BOS Lab 2 is nearing 90% physical space utilization and lab temperatures are above what is recommended for the lab environment. Eng-ops is looking into purchasing additional thermal sensors and cold air curtains to improve monitoring and cooling capabilities.\r\n\r\n   + This project has already been started but could take 3-6 months based on: budget appropriation, equipment procurement lead times, curtain installation and tying all of the thermal sensors into a useful monitoring utility. The lab temperatures aren't nearing critical levels so this project isn't urgent.\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops and Facilities conducted a thermal test in lab two over the weekend and found that we can reduce the lab temperatures by a few degrees when running all three chillers simultaneously. This isn't optimal but could serve as a fall back plan for us if lab temperatures begin to spike during the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n**Global Split**\r\n\r\n+ Usual stream of lab installation and issues handled.\r\n\r\n+ Hiring process began for JR lab admins in Boston, planning for other geos will be finalized shortly.

HW replacement for the hypervisors is in place however it takes some time to move the guests over. Most of them have to be moved during the next maintenance window (June 8th). The most critical for now is the storage cluster: hardware replacement for it wasn't even ordered yet (RT# 132548)\r\n\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Dell Ops-util unit (responsible for BOS lab DNS and DHCP) is out of warranty. There are no backup units currently in place and any downtime on this unit will hold up critical BOS lab functions. We have already had to replace a CPU once. Eng-ops currently lacks the resources required to get the Ops-util replacement blades online. what is required to do it?\r\nThe replacement blades for this unit need to be brought online and configured for redundant 'fail safe' operation. We just lost our sr. systems admin in BOS and we don't currently have any sys admins with the experience or available time to start this project. We are looking into alternative solutions that are less resource intensive.\r\n\r\n+ BOS Lab 2 is nearing 90% physical space utilization and lab temperatures are above what is recommended for the lab environment. Eng-ops is looking into purchasing additional thermal sensors and cold air curtains to improve monitoring and cooling capabilities.\r\n\r\n   + This project has already been started but could take 3-6 months based on: budget appropriation, equipment procurement lead times, curtain installation and tying all of the thermal sensors into a useful monitoring utility. The lab temperatures aren't nearing critical levels so this project isn't urgent.\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops and Facilities conducted a thermal test in lab two over the weekend and found that we can reduce the lab temperatures by a few degrees when running all three chillers simultaneously. This isn't optimal but could serve as a fall back plan for us if lab temperatures begin to spike during the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n**Global Split**\r\n\r\n+ Usual stream of lab installation and issues handled.\r\n\r\n+ Hiring process began for JR lab admins in Boston, planning for other geos will be finalized shortly. Process still ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ translate.engineering.redhat.com was upgraded to zanata 1.6\r\n\r\n+ staging environment for rhel6 migration of performance book complete\r\n\r\n+ hss-portal production environment upgraded\r\n\r\n+ Provisioning of new eng-ops monitoring service (engineering.redhat.com/monitor) complete, awaiting testing\r\n\r\n+ Review of Openstack for BNE cloud project complete.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Ongoing VM migration to the new infrastructure hardware.\r\n\r\n+ Reviewed MWC infrastructure issues and proposed a scenario to solve them. \r\n\r\n+ Getting people involved in working on foreign subgroup tasks (Pavel started working with Tomas for MW QE, Vadim is now receiving nagios alerts for the MWC infrastructure, Tomas was added to systems team's nagios).\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Racked and configured critical Infiniband hardware for Gluster team (RHS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Coming Up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n####Global####\r\n\r\n+ Planning and deployment of Qpid, Globalsync and Alfresco hosts.\r\n\r\n+ RDU lab move planning (ongoing).\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ New storage infrastructure in NAY and globalsync v3 being brought online.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of NAY QE machines into Beaker\r\n\r\n+ Capex purchasing for NAY finalised\r\n\r\n+ Eng ops standard services (globalsync et.al) procurement and deployment into BLR.\r\n\r\n+ product360 go live scheduled at some point next week following resolution of issues with product360.\r\n\r\n+ Start of recruitment for Brisbane BNE mid level admin position.\r\n\r\n+ Start of documentation relating to tools development process and eng-ops requirements for deployments.\r\n\r\n+ Internal private docs deployment.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Review MWC documentation (ongoing till July 1st)\r\n\r\n+ Order the replacement cluster hardware (approved in oracle)\r\n\r\n+ MRD drafted for JBOSS.org Infrastructure Issue at [DRAFT](http://dart.qe.lab.eng.bne.redhat.com/Eng_Ops_Projects/JBOSS_Infrastructure_Issue/tmp/en-US/html-single/)\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Strategic planning for BOS lab expansion is under-way. Eng-ops to present a list of lab requirements to BOS expansion committee.\r\n\r\n+ Gluster storage (RHS) 'phase two' order is being finalized for submission and purchasing. Eng-ops is evaluating lab space and infrastructure requirements.

However, one RHEL6.3.z subscription-manager errata is still waiting to be pushed out before 20th June; although not blocking RHEL6.3 GA, seven RHEL6.3 deployment guide bugs are waiting to be fixed. The Team will now focus on RHEL5.9 test planning and plan to send RHEL5.9 Entitlement IEEE Test Plan draft to Devel/PM to review before 18th July.\r\n\r\n\r\nQE Test result summary \r\n---------------------- \r\n\r\n![Green](./images/Green.png)\\ **[subscription-manager]** \r\n\r\n+ RHEL6.3-RC-2 subscription-manager-gui smoke testing against Production Candlepin by Hosted QE: **PASS** (cached)\r\n\r\n    + Test result was PASS as there was no critical regression or test blockers found.\r\n\r\n+ RHEL6.3-RC-2 testing were skipped for Cloud QE and RTT because no RHSM related packages were changed from snapshot5 to RC2, and snapshot5 acceptance tests by Cloud QE and RTT were both PASS.\r\n \r\n+ [RHBA-2012:12609-01](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/stateview/12609) - subscription-manager was pushed to REL_PREP on June 1st by Cloud QE.\r\n\r\n+ [RHBA-2012:12610-01](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/stateview/12610) - python-rhsm was pushed to REL_PREP on June 1st by Cloud QE.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Green](./images/green.png)\\ **[subscription-manager-migration-data]** \r\n\r\n+ subscription-manager-migration-data-1.12.1.8-1.el6.noarch was tested by Cloud QE: **PASS** (cached)\r\n\r\n    + Test result was PASS as there was no critical regression or test blockers found.\r\n\r\n+ [RHEA-2012:12635-01](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/stateview/12635) - subscription-manager-migration-data was pushed to REL_PREP on June 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Green](./images/green.png)\\ **[virt-who]** \r\n\r\n+ virt-who smoke test on RHEL6.3-server-20120604.0 (kvm) against SAM-06-04.1 by Hosted QE: **PASS** (cached)\r\n\r\n    + Test result was PASS as there was no critical regression or test blockers found.\r\n\r\n+ [RHBA-2012:12775-01](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/stateview/12775) - virt-who, was pushed to REL_PREP on June 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Green](./images/green.png)\\ **[content testing]** \r\n\r\n+ RHEL6.3-RC content testing against with QA CDN by Hosted QE: **PASS** (cached)\r\n\r\n    + Test result got PASS as there was no critical regression or test blockers found.

No SKU testing was made during the course of the week.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see QE Test result details at the end of the online report. \r\n\r\nRisks/Actions \r\n-------------- \r\n1.

Need Content Services team to fix following RHEL6.3 deployment guide bugs. The deployment guide will only be available online, so it should not block RHEL6.3 GA. However, since the deployment guide is cross-referenced in Release Notes which tell customers how to deploy and use subscription-manager, QE expect these bugs to be fixed before RHEL6.3 GA.\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831052](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831052) - Options username and password should be required when registering with consumerid [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831064](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831064) - List --installed could not display subscribed but not installed products [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831110](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831110) - Change button \"Update\" to \"Auto-subscribe\" and change dialog \"Subscription Assistant\" to \"Subscribe System\" [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831093](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831093) - Redundant step for auto-subscribe during registering should be removed [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831120](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831120) - Could not use install-num-migrate-to-rhsm in rhel6 [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831131](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831131) - Outputs of config --remove should be the same whether default value exist or not [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831182](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831182) - A system can only be in one environment [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed \r\n-------------- \r\n+ Reviewed Deployment_Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up \r\n-------------- \r\n\r\n+ Content testing for RHEL6.3 on Production CDN.\r\n\r\n+ Draft RHEL5.9 Entitlement IEEE Test Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- \r\nQE Test result details \r\n---------------------- \r\n\r\n--------- \r\ncategory: June, Week 25\r\n", "author"=>"IanNeilsen", "web"=>"entitlement63", "id"=>"IanNeilsen"}

However, one RHEL6.3.z subscription-manager errata is still waiting to be pushed out before 20th June; although not blocking RHEL6.3 GA, seven RHEL6.3 deployment guide bugs are waiting to be fixed. The Team will now focus on RHEL5.9 test planning and plan to send RHEL5.9 Entitlement IEEE Test Plan draft to Devel/PM to review before 18th July.\r\n\r\n\r\nQE Test result summary \r\n---------------------- \r\n\r\n[[Green.png:pic]] **[subscription-manager]** \r\n\r\n+ RHEL6.3-RC-2 subscription-manager-gui smoke testing against Production Candlepin by Hosted QE: **PASS** (cached)\r\n\r\n   + Test result was PASS as there was no critical regression or test blockers found.\r\n\r\n+ RHEL6.3-RC-2 testing were skipped for Cloud QE and RTT because no RHSM related packages were changed from snapshot5 to RC2, and snapshot5 acceptance tests by Cloud QE and RTT were both PASS.\r\n \r\n+ [RHBA-2012:12609-01](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/stateview/12609) - subscription-manager was pushed to REL_PREP on June 1st by Cloud QE.\r\n\r\n+ [RHBA-2012:12610-01](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/stateview/12610) - python-rhsm was pushed to REL_PREP on June 1st by Cloud QE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[Green.png:pic]] **[subscription-manager-migration-data]** \r\n\r\n+ subscription-manager-migration-data-1.12.1.8-1.el6.noarch was tested by Cloud QE: **PASS** (cached)\r\n\r\n   + Test result was PASS as there was no critical regression or test blockers found.\r\n\r\n+ [RHEA-2012:12635-01](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/stateview/12635) - subscription-manager-migration-data was pushed to REL_PREP on June 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[Green.png:pic]] **[virt-who]** \r\n\r\n+ virt-who smoke test on RHEL6.3-server-20120604.0 (kvm) against SAM-06-04.1 by Hosted QE: **PASS** (cached)\r\n\r\n   + Test result was PASS as there was no critical regression or test blockers found.\r\n\r\n+ [RHBA-2012:12775-01](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/stateview/12775) - virt-who, was pushed to REL_PREP on June 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[Green.png:pic]] **[content testing]** \r\n\r\n+ RHEL6.3-RC content testing against with QA CDN by Hosted QE: **PASS** (cached)\r\n\r\n   + Test result got PASS as there was no critical regression or test blockers found.

Need Content Services team to fix following RHEL6.3 deployment guide bugs. The deployment guide will only be available online, so it should not block RHEL6.3 GA. However, since the deployment guide is cross-referenced in Release Notes which tell customers how to deploy and use subscription-manager, QE expect these bugs to be fixed before RHEL6.3 GA.\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831052](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831052) - Options username and password should be required when registering with consumerid [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831064](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831064) - List --installed could not display subscribed but not installed products [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831110](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831110) - Change button \"Update\" to \"Auto-subscribe\" and change dialog \"Subscription Assistant\" to \"Subscribe System\" [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831093](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831093) - Redundant step for auto-subscribe during registering should be removed [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831120](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831120) - Could not use install-num-migrate-to-rhsm in rhel6 [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831131](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831131) - Outputs of config --remove should be the same whether default value exist or not [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831182](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831182) - A system can only be in one environment [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed \r\n-------------- \r\n\r\n+ Reviewed Deployment_Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up \r\n-------------- \r\n\r\n+ Content testing for RHEL6.3 on Production CDN.\r\n\r\n+ Draft RHEL5.9 Entitlement IEEE Test Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- \r\nQE Test result details \r\n---------------------- \r\n\r\n--------- \r\ncategory: June, Week 25\r\n", "author"=>"IanNeilsen", "web"=>"entitlement63", "id"=>"IanNeilsen"}

Need Content Services team to fix following RHEL6.3 deployment guide bugs. The deployment guide will only be available online, so it should not block RHEL6.3 GA. However, since the deployment guide is cross-referenced in Release Notes which tell customers how to deploy and use subscription-manager, QE expect these bugs to be fixed before RHEL6.3 GA.\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831052](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831052) - Options username and password should be required when registering with consumerid [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831064](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831064) - List --installed could not display subscribed but not installed products [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831110](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831110) - Change button \"Update\" to \"Auto-subscribe\" and change dialog \"Subscription Assistant\" to \"Subscribe System\" [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831093](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831093) - Redundant step for auto-subscribe during registering should be removed [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831120](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831120) - Could not use install-num-migrate-to-rhsm in rhel6 [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831131](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831131) - Outputs of config --remove should be the same whether default value exist or not [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831182](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831182) - A system can only be in one environment [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed \r\n-------------- \r\n\r\n+ Reviewed Deployment_Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up \r\n-------------- \r\n\r\n+ Content testing for RHEL6.3 on Production CDN.\r\n\r\n+ Draft RHEL5.9 Entitlement IEEE Test Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- \r\nQE Test result details \r\n---------------------- \r\n\r\n--------- \r\ncategory: June, Week 25\r\n", "author"=>"IanNeilsen", "web"=>"entitlement63", "id"=>"Entitlement Weekly Executive Briefing - Week 25"}

Need Content Services team to fix following RHEL6.3 deployment guide bugs. The deployment guide will only be available online, so it should not block RHEL6.3 GA. However, since the deployment guide is cross-referenced in Release Notes which tell customers how to deploy and use subscription-manager, QE expect these bugs to be fixed before RHEL6.3 GA.\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831052](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831052) - Options username and password should be required when registering with consumerid [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831064](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831064) - List --installed could not display subscribed but not installed products [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831110](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831110) - Change button \"Update\" to \"Auto-subscribe\" and change dialog \"Subscription Assistant\" to \"Subscribe System\" [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831093](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831093) - Redundant step for auto-subscribe during registering should be removed [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831120](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831120) - Could not use install-num-migrate-to-rhsm in rhel6 [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831131](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831131) - Outputs of config --remove should be the same whether default value exist or not [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n    + [Bug 831182](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=831182) - A system can only be in one environment [MODIFIED]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork completed \r\n-------------- \r\n\r\n+ Reviewed Deployment_Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork coming up \r\n-------------- \r\n\r\n+ Content testing for RHEL6.3 on Production CDN.\r\n\r\n+ Draft RHEL5.9 Entitlement IEEE Test Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- \r\nQE Test result details \r\n---------------------- \r\n\r\n--------- \r\ncategory: June, Week 25\r\n", "author"=>"IanNeilsen", "web"=>"entitlement63", "id"=>"Entitlement Weekly Executive Briefing - Week 25"}
