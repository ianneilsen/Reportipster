Executive summary 
=================
 
Testing started **Tuesday July 24th 2012** finished **Monday July 30th 2012** 

Report for week 31, 2012. 

+ Except for Red Hat Storage (RHS), package manifests of &quot;DTS&quot;, rhev-agent repos and JBoss products are now provided by RCM.

+ In the past week, HSS QE focused on JBoss SKU bugs verification, content testing of DTS with package manifest offered by RCM and refactoring content and SKU automation scripts.

+ This week, we will keep on verifying content of JBoss products and rhev-agent repos with packages manifest provided by RCM.


QE Test result summary 
---------------------- 

[[RED.png:pic]] **[content testing]** 

+ Content testing of **DTS** against Production CDN by HSS QE: **FAIL** 

   + Test result got FAIL as there were a test blocker existed.

      + [Bug 844234](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=844234) - Cert sizes of some SKU's are too large [MODIFIED,high]
      + [Bug 844242](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=844242) - eng_products mapped to SKU of &quot;DTS&quot; mismatch between entitlement cert and Reference DOC-95917 [VERIFIED]
      + [Bug 837188](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=837188) - yum repolist raise error Errno 14 problem making ssl connection&quot; [CLOSED DUPLICATE of bug 844234]


+ Content testing of **rhev-agent** repos against Production CDN by HSS QE: **Conditional PASS**

   + Test result got Conditional PASS as content validation with package manifest is still under testing.
        
     + Content testing of rhev-agent repos over variant Server,  Client and Workstation on arches x86_64 and i386 with RHEL6.3GA and RHEL5.8 GA.
        
     + [Bug 841754](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=841754) - Packages of rhev-agent binary repos are pushed to incorrect directory on Production CDN [VERIFIED, waiting to be set to &quot;ON_QA&quot;]


+ Content testing of **OpenShift** against QA CDN by HSS QE: **FAIL** 

   + Test result got FAIL as there was a high severity bug found. Since the account stage_test_89 for OpenShift has no available subscriptions, the bug verification is pending. 
    
      + [Bug 838405](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=838405) - Product cert of Openshift could not been installed after installing packages [MODIFIED, high]


+ Content testing for **JBoss** products against QA CDN by HSS QE: **FAIL** (cached)

   + Test result got FAIL as there was no available subscription for available accounts.
    
      + Accounts for JBoss subscriptions on Stage Candlepin:  

         + stage_test_68, stage_test_69, stage_test_71, stage_test_72, stage_test_73,  stage_test_74, stage_test_76, stage_test_78, stage_test_79, stage_test_85, stage_test_87


+ Content testing of **Red Hat Storage** against Production CDN by HSS QE: **FAIL** (cached)

   + Test result got FAIL as there was a high severity bug found. Since  due date of content testing of RHS is ASAP, however, the bug  still has no progress,  need RCM guys help to pay more attention to it.
    
      + [Bug 836469](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=836469) - No repos for product &quot;Red Hat Storage&quot; [ASSIGNED, FailedQA, NEEDINFO]
 
 
[[RED.png:pic]] **[SKU testing]**

+ Verify cert size of SKUs (MCT2027 and RC0161757) by HSS QE: **PASS** 

   + Test result was PASS as the cert size of the two SKUs don't exceed the upper limit (139264 bytes). More detail information refer to ticket:[RT 162337](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=162337).


+ SKU testing of JBoss products against Stage Candlepin by HSS QE: **FAIL** (cached)

   + Test result was FAIL as many attributes of these products listed in [DOC-95917](https://docspace.corp.redhat.com/docs/DOC-95917) are mismatched with that gotten from Stage Candlepin.  We reported 8 bugs to trace all the mismatches, thanks to Amanda and Robbie, six of them have been repaired, however, still other two are waiting to be fixed.

      + [Bug 841097](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=841097) JBoss - sku attribute &quot;jon_management&quot; mismatch between stage Candlepin and Reference DOC-95917 [still waiting to be fixed]

         + Got Amanda's reply for this bug: This is pending a release by IT
            
      + [Bug 841090](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=841090) JBoss - sku attribute &quot;arch&quot; mismatch between stage Candlepin and Reference DOC-95917 [still waiting to be fixed]

         + Got Amanda's reply for this bug: This is still pending confirmation.

      + [Bug 841101](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=841101) JBoss - sku attribute &quot;unlimited_product&quot; mismatch between stage Candlepin and Reference DOC-95917 [VERIFIED]
      + [Bug 841100](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=841100) JBoss - sku attribute &quot;support_level&quot; mismatch between stage Candlepin and Reference DOC-95917 [VERIFIED]
      + [Bug 841093](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=841093) JBoss - sku attribute &quot;sockets&quot; mismatch between stage Candlepin and Reference DOC-95917 [VERIFIED]
      + [Bug 841094](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=841094) JBoss - sku attribute &quot;virt_limit&quot; mismatch between stage Candlepin and Reference DOC-95917 [VERIFIED]
      + [Bug 841095](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=841095) JBoss - sku attribute &quot;variant&quot; mismatch between stage Candlepin and Reference DOC-95917 [VERIFIED]
      + [Bug 841099](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=841099) JBoss - sku attribute &quot;product_family&quot; mismatch between stage Candlepin and Reference DOC-95917 [VERIFIED]



For more information, see QE Test result details at the end of the online report. 

Risks/Actions 
-------------- 

+ Need RCM to provide package manifests for &quot;Red Hat Storage&quot; (RHS) and &quot;Openshift&quot;. Without them we can not do content testing for these products. The requested dates for completing content testing of theses products are:  ASAP and 15th August 2012 respectively.

+ Many accounts of Stage Candlepin still have no available subscriptions after refreshing Stage Candlepin on 10th July 2012. 

   + We expect IT to fix these issues ASAP. Otherwise SKU or content testing related to these accounts will be blocked.
        
   + [Bug 844403](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=844403) - No available subscriptions for some accounts on stage candlepin [ASSIGNED, high]
        
+ Content testing for DTS products was blocked by [Bug 844234](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=844234) - Cert sizes of some SKUs are too large [MODIFIED,high].

+ Content testing for RHS product was FAIL due to [Bug 844586](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=844586) - No repomd&amp;content for repos rhsc-2.0-for-rhel-6-server-* on Production CDN [NEW, high]

Work completed 
-------------- 

+ Verified bug about content of rhev-agent repos over variant Server, Client and Workstation against Production CDN.

+ Verified content of DTS products with package manifest provided by RCM against Production CDN.

+ Verified two bugs of JBoss SKUs.


Work coming up 
-------------- 

+ Verify mapping between eng-products and SKU.

+ Verify content of rhev-agent repos with package manifest against Production CDN.

+ Content testing for JBoss products against QA CDN.

+ Verify content of &quot;Red Hat Storage&quot; on Production CDN.

+ Verify content of &quot;OpenShift&quot; against Production CDN.

+ Verify content of &quot;DTS&quot; on Production CDN.
