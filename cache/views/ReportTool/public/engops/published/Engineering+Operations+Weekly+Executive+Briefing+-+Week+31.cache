<!-- </div> -->
    
<h1 id='executive_summary_1'>Executive summary</h1>

<p>Week starting <strong>Saturday July 21 2012</strong> ending <strong>Friday July 27 2012</strong></p>

<p>Report generated in week 31, 2012.</p>

<h1 id='apac_2'>APAC</h1>

<h4 id='bne_3'>BNE</h4>

<h2 id='risksactions_4'>Risks/Actions</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Deployment of Beacon and Newspaper is currently blocked. The hardware has arrived, yet an audit of the existing infrastructure revealed that it was under utilized. Plan for reorganizing this infrastructure has been completed and work on setting up the hardware has begun. It is expected to be completed over the next few weeks.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Beacon 1.2 and Newspaper 1.2 are almost in QE testing phase but there is a risk of slippage due to inadequate hardware available in BOS to handle the testing environment. A strategy has been developed to mitigate this by temporarily turning the Beacon staging environment into a testing environment for QE.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The MirrorManager project undertaken by mgrigull has stalled due to the lack of quality in the software itself. At the moment it is not possible to determine if a deployment of the software inside Red Hat will be feasible. The developer of Mirror Manager has been contacted to see if they can help us with the deployment issues.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='work_completed_5'>Work completed</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>New documentation servers for Publican 3.0 have been completed. This will allow all books to be rebuilt in Publican 3.0 and rolled out to docs.redhat.com for further integration into the access.redhat.com portal</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Zanata staging and production environments upgrade to 1.7. This major release includes new features needed for the Red Hat translation team to do work on Red Hat products. Additional maintenance work on the staging and production environments was performed including better logging and more robust configuration.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Beaker staging environment was upgraded to version 0.9.1</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The “EngVDBD” teiid virtual database used for development was updated with the latest changes needed for Bugzilla, Errata, salesforce.com, and TCMS. This will allow IED development work integrating with teiid to progress further.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Interviews for the Eng-Ops BNE role have been undertaken. It is expected that a final decision on the role will be made before the end of next week.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='work_coming_up_6'>Work coming up</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OpenStack project has begun and is currently in the process of doing testing of all advertised OpenStack features to ensure it meets the requirement.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Evaluation of Jenkins as a continuous integration tool. This work will be completed by ggillies, weizhang, zdou and huili. Once the evaluation is complete it will allow Eng-Ops to move ahead with a production deployment.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Gerrit deployment to a production environment. This will eventually be offered as a service to all of Engineering as a general use code review tool.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Eng-Ops “Graphing” project is expected to move into the investigation phase. This project will allow Eng-Ops to deploy a consistent solution for tracking system utilization and performance, enhancing our ability to do capacity planning and isolate problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='nay_7'>NAY</h4>

<h2 id='risksactions_8'>Risks/Actions</h2>

<p>1.The NAY facility requires cabling and cable settings for five (5) cages worth of hardware (for FY13 purchasing which is onging). Wei Zhang got the quote and created RT#161464 to track it. Still waiting for the budget. Failure to resolve this will impact the roll out of systems for Beaker (Kernel QE and Virt QE) as well as tools development work in NAY.</p>

<h2 id='work_completed_9'>Work completed</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>NAY Sysadmins have continued to be trained in setting up production systems for Eng-Ops tools. This will ease the workload on the Eng-Ops APAC team and allowing them to focus on higher level tasks.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>TCMS was updated to release 3.8.0. New features added.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Assistance in setting up the new documentation servers needed for Publican 3.0 outlined above.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Maitai production environment was setup. This will allow the Maitai project to move into a production phase when ready, which is expected to happen in the coming weeks.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There are 70 Virt-QE test machines which were not running virtLAB auto test jobs that need to migrate into Beaker. Almost all of them finished, including DNS/DHCP records change, adding into beaker UI, running provision job for each host. After the migration, Eng-ops will eventually add serial console for them. Currently they are connected by KVM for tty as Virt-QE original requirement.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='work_coming_up_10'>Work coming up</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Migrate all Virt-QE machines which do not run virtLAB auto test jobs into Beaker. This will continue the process of spinning down virtLAB and allow those hardware resources to be better used in Beaker. The long term the goal is to move all virtLAB hardware into beaker.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Cable and Set up 5 racks for FY13 new hardware. This is to accommodate the FY13 CAPEX purchasing which sees a large influx of new hardware into the NAY lab.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='pnq_11'>PNQ</h4>

<h2 id='risksactions_12'>Risks/Actions</h2>

<ul>
<li>RHS lab setup in BLR</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='work_completed_13'>Work completed</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Got GlobalSync in BLR up and running. Switched OS version to RHEL 5 as GlobalSync v2 is not supported on RHEL 6. Fixed initialization issues by manually updating GlobalSync database and downgrading rsync (#161775).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Lab controller in BLR ready. Switched TFTP server for BLR vLANs from manually setup TFTP server to BLR Beaker lab controller. Tested manual installations via PXE using the new Beaker generated PXE menus.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed PXE menu issues. Updated menu.c32 to latest version on PNQ lab controller to get nested menus working.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added nightly trees to PXE menu in PNQ, BLR, and BOS to enable RHS nightlies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Switch DHCP servers for BLR vLAN 150 and vLAN 151 to ns2.eng.blr.redhat.com from ns1.eng.pnq.redhat.com</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Network outage at BLR, happened when IT were adding a new switch. All cluster services had to be reset.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Updated, brewed, signed, and pushed new cfengine-engops-cfg for adding blr cfengine server.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Tested/troubleshooted/verified cfengine server in BLR. Configured all BLR systems to use BLR cfengine server.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Nagios alerts for GS.tlv space. Enabled deletion of trees not present upstream for RHEL 6 nightlies and rel-eng.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>ns1.eng.blr.redhat.com setup as a slave server. We already have ns2.eng.blr.redhat.com as caching server.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='work_coming_up_14'>Work coming up</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Purchase racks and PDUs for BLR lab.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Installation of Super Micro Servers (phase I) in BLR.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id='emea_15'>EMEA</h1>

<h4 id='tlv_16'>TLV</h4>

<h2 id='risksactions_17'>Risks/Actions</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Kernel Panic on RHCS nodes after update. Currently using old kernel, won’t touch until the next maintenance window.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Package conflicts on one of the cluster nodes. RPM database rebuild didn’t help. May require a re-kick. Was probably caused by some earlier yum or rpm bug.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Temperature is still above threshold but facilities promised to optimize airflow in the main lab ASAP (no ETA). Expert was on site for analysis and gave written recommendations.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='work_completed_18'>Work completed</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Redundant networking on infrastructure hosts. The chassis is connected to two redundant switches, systems have bonding in place.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Involved Dotan in JBoss QE related work. Filled the need of Windows admins in the group.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='work_coming_up_19'>Work coming up</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite of JBoss community puppet modules. Sasha will start analysis and rewrite of the puppet modules for the ability to standardise staging and production environments.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='brq_20'>BRQ</h4>

<h2 id='risksactions_21'>Risks/Actions</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Hardware errors on one of the cluster heads. rhcs-01 was unable to access the clustered volumes after kernel update. Now running old kernel, the chassis still reports PCI errors - could be a firmware bug. Will be solved with IBM.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Magnolia cache problems are still not being identified by our monitoring system: there is a logging issue which prevents us to use check_log nagios plugin.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Latest beaker upgrade required debugifo packages for operation. Those were synced to BRQ and normal activity was restored.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We’re running out of lab space very fast. We need a decision on the expansion path we are going to take (10,000 sq ft lab vs. small lab below the existing one). Can shuffle the machines a bit to pack in more hardware, but this is only a temporary solution.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='work_completed_22'>Work completed</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>GlobalSync data moved to the new cluster. Huge I/O performance increase.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>download.eng.brq is now a clustered service with fault tolerance. One of the cluster heads now serves NFS, second one HTTP, FTP, RSYNC, and SMB requests, each will take over other node’s service in case of failure.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>IPv6 enabled on download-01.eng.brq and nfs-01.eng.brq. First step towards IPv6 only installs in beaker.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Middleware staging was restored after data loss. NFS data was pulled from PHX2, Engineers are able to stage new releases again.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='work_coming_up_23'>Work coming up</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>IPv6 DHCP to advertise IPv6 DNS servers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Try switch confluence and search from ajp:// to http:// and see if this fixes the threading issues on the application server. Only those two use ajp:// and only there the problem occurs.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='bos_24'>BOS</h4>

<h2 id='risksactions_25'>Risks/Actions</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>UPS replacement in IT server room - August 4, 2012, 8am-4pm.</p>

<p>The UPS in the BOS IT server room is currently being scheduled by facilities for replacement on August 4, 2012. This will completely bring down the IT network in the BOS building, effectively taking down all BOS lab connectivity for a minimum of 8+ hours. All global testing/building capabilities will be down within the BOS labs during this time frame.</p>

<p>Notifications have been sent to the lab delegates and stakeholders specifying the risks and requesting feedback from any groups who have test plans that could be impacted by this outage.</p>

<p>If August 4 is an issue for any groups, the UPS replacement will get pushed out to August 11, 18, or 25 based on scheduling concerns or any other considerations raised by the lab stakeholders.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='work_completed_26'>Work completed</h2>

<ul>
<li>Gluster phase #2: (performance group). Racked up Gluster phase #2 and adjusted cage space in Lab 1 to accommodate new racks for phase #2. This task is on schedule, but, the cables still need to be labeled and run (Done), and the DRACs need to be configured. This project will be completely wrapped up within two weeks. DRAC setup and back end work is pending IT to configure the switches for the new racks. Phase 2 deployment should be completed by 8/3/2012.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='work_coming_up_27'>Work coming up</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lab environment monitoring project. Lab monitoring is becoming necessary due to some of the labs nearing their peak power/physical space utilization. Eng-ops requires a more sophisticated thermal and power monitoring system to ensure lab hardware isn’t put at risk due to thermal thresholds being breached. The lab monitoring system will be put in place for BOS in the short term. If the system tests well in BOS, the hardware and procedures we utilized will be scaled to global lab environments. Met with APC software reps on 7/16/2012 and evaluated the DCIM thermal monitoring and inventory utility they’ve developed. Discussions within Eng-Ops are ongoing regarding the features we require within our lab environment. Team members will be meeting 7/27/2012 to discuss the next steps required to acquire and implement a monitoring utility.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Gluster phase #3 order. (QA group). Physical lab space to be allocated once phase #2 is in place. Cage walls in lab 1 may need removal to fit phase #3 in with the other gluster racks. Servers will arrive, be received, racked, cabled, configured (this task is very resource intensive). To begin after 8/3/2012 when phase #2 is in place.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='rdu_28'>RDU</h4>

<h2 id='risksactions_29'>Risks/Actions</h2>

<p>None to report this week.</p>

<h2 id='work_completed_30'>Work completed</h2>

<ul>
<li>New purchasing procedure created for RDU hardware purchasing. The procedure will be fully effective when the RDU move to the new building is complete. The new procedure will properly direct purchased hardware to the RDU HQ lab or RDU colo facility based on the hands on nature of the hardware. This procedure will help clarify RDU lab location guidelines to the customer groups now that the lab facility in RDU will be split between two separate locations.</li>
