This is a pretty significant release and will require database changes as well as the removal and replacement of cobbler with beaker-provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n \r\nBrief summaries explaining MAJOR issues/happenings etc and what is being done about it. Including DATES is good.\r\n\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ Ongoing issues with TCMS application (3rd time for data loss)\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Multiple issues in .org environment. Confluence app (http://docs.jboss.org/author) is very unstable for a few weeks. Root cause is still unknown.\r\n\r\n+ See labs section\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon is on PTO since Thursday => no installations will be done in BRQ during next 2 weeks\r\n\r\n+ TLV cooling issues are ongoing. Expert has been invited to propose solving the issue: covering gaps between servers was recommended. Some machines are blowing hot air in the cold corridor.\r\n\r\n+ A new quote has been obtained regarding changing all racks and re-cabling the servers in lab-4 in TLV.\r\n\r\n+ beaker 0.9 upgrade completed. Not without issues but fortunately there were no major outages. No more cobbler on lab controllers.\r\n\r\n+ Dell Ops-util unit (responsible for BOS lab DNS and DHCP) is out of warranty. There are no backup units currently in place and any downtime on this unit will hold up critical BOS lab functions. We have already had to replace a CPU once. Eng-ops currently lacks the resources required to get the Ops-util replacement blades online. what is required to do it?\r\nThe replacement blades for this unit need to be brought online and configured for redundant 'fail safe' operation. We just lost our sr. systems admin in BOS and we don't currently have any sys admins with the experience or available time to start this project. We are looking into alternative solutions that are less resource intensive.\r\n\r\n+ BOS Lab 2 is nearing 90% physical space utilization and lab temperatures are above what is recommended for the lab environment. Eng-ops is looking into purchasing additional thermal sensors and cold air curtains to improve monitoring and cooling capabilites. [mdoyle] when will the looking into part be done, and the fixing of the problem part begin?\r\nThis project has already been started but could take 3-6 months based on: budget appropriation, equipment procurement lead times, curtain installation and tying all of the thermal sensors into a usefull monitoring utility. The lab temperatures aren't nearing critical levels so this project isn't urgent.\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops and Facilities conducted a thermal test in lab two over the weekend and found that we can reduce the lab temperatures by a few degrees when running all three chillers simultaneously. This isn't optimal but could serve as a fall back plan for us if lab temperatures begin to spike during the summer.\r\n\r\nLab monitoring planning and progress are being tracked through:\r\n(Planning: RT #101695)\r\n(Progress: RT #155669)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nMajor works completed. Try to deliver more than just point form. See the beaker example below for guidance.\r\n\r\n**Global Split**\r\n\r\n+ Usual stream of lab installation and issues handled.\r\n\r\n+ Hiring process began for JR lab admins in Boston, planning for other geos will be finalized shortly. Process still ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ pride.engineering.redhat.com was brought inline.\r\n\r\n+ maitai devel environment deployed on EAP6.\r\n\r\n+ Instance of \"Think Free\" application for case study deployed.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of zk-devel instance to bos for larger testing completed.\r\n\r\n+ Capex purchasing for NAY.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Cluster replacement hardware arrived on Tuesday, hopefully will have it up and running by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n+ Continued work on Jboss.org infrastructure issues definition. Waiting for approval in vault: https://vault-stage.englab.nay.redhat.com/Vault/showRequest/918\r\n\r\n+ Reviewed MWC documentation. Most important bits are there, however dlisnich has to document the services he spun up.\r\n\r\n+ Put together the requirements for the second sysadmin position.\r\n\r\n+ Had firsrt candidate that applied for the MW admin position. HR promised more by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Racked and configured critical Infiniband hardware for Gluster team (RHS).\r\n\r\n+ pasimon installed all systems he had in his queue prior to PTO\r\n\r\n+ TLV folks finished the installation and configuration of the HW in the new lab\r\n\r\n+ Discussed the expansion options in BRQ. Agreed that we'll reserve the place below the current lab for future expansion. Might move the HW completely out of this building if the 10.000 sq ft lab buildout gets approved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Coming Up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nwhat is happening, who will it affect and when is it  occuring. Llim likes the initiatives, he would like to provide dates so  people can anticipate the jobs coming up.\r\n\r\n####Global####\r\n\r\n+ Planning and deployment of Qpid, Globalsync and Alfresco hosts.\r\n\r\n+ RDU lab move planning (ongoing).\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ New storage infrastructure in NAY and globalsync v3 being brought online.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of NAY QE machines into Beaker\r\n\r\n+ Eng ops standard services (globalsync et.al) procurement and deployment into BLR.\r\n\r\n+ Start of recuritment for Brisbane BNE mid level admin position.\r\n\r\n+ Start of documentation relating to tools development process and eng-ops requirements for deployements.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Finish MWC documentation.\r\n\r\n+ Continue hiring process for the two positions (only one officially open yet).\r\n\r\n+ dpaz in RHCSA training next week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Strategic planning for BOS lab expansion is underway. Eng-ops to present a list of lab requirements to BOS expansion committee.\r\n\r\n+ Gluster storage (RHS) phase 2 order has been racked in lab 1.  The racks will be get network/power when the cage wall in lab 1 is taken down. The cage area will need modification before we can roll the racks into place. We're currently doing an infrastructure evaluation of the lab space for phase 2 and phase 3 this week. Once this is complete, I'll be able to provide an estimated completion date.\r\n\r\n+ TLV is getting one more floor, meaning one more lab. More space = good. ETA - not sooner than a few months to half a year.\r\n\r\n####USA####\r\n\r\n+ (2) new lab admins have started in Westford on June 4.\r\n\r\n+ (1) mid level candidate started June 20, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGeo leads: \r\n\r\nUSA - \"Matthew Schick\" <mschick@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nAPAC - \"Graeme Gillies\" <ggillies@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nEMEA - \"Vadim Grinco\" <vgrinco@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nLabs - \"Josh Nicolet\" <jnicolet@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nRAP - \"Ian Neilsen\" <ineilsen@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nSupplementary or supporting information or data.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever is put in this section will be visible in the online report but will not be sent out in the email version.\r\n\r\n", "author"=>"IanNeilsen", "web"=>"operations", "id"=>"IanNeilsen"}

Including DATES is good.\r\n\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ Ongoing issues with TCMS application (3rd time for data loss)\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Multiple issues in .org environment. Confluence app (http://docs.jboss.org/author) is very unstable for a few weeks. Root cause is still unknown.\r\n\r\n+ See labs section\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon is on PTO since Thursday => no installations will be done in BRQ during next 2 weeks\r\n\r\n+ TLV cooling issues are ongoing. Expert has been invited to propose solving the issue: covering gaps between servers was recommended. Some machines are blowing hot air in the cold corridor.\r\n\r\n+ A new quote has been obtained regarding changing all racks and re-cabling the servers in lab-4 in TLV.\r\n\r\n+ beaker 0.9 upgrade completed. Not without issues but fortunately there were no major outages. No more cobbler on lab controllers.\r\n\r\n+ Dell Ops-util unit (responsible for BOS lab DNS and DHCP) is out of warranty. There are no backup units currently in place and any downtime on this unit will hold up critical BOS lab functions. We have already had to replace a CPU once. Eng-ops currently lacks the resources required to get the Ops-util replacement blades online. what is required to do it?\r\nThe replacement blades for this unit need to be brought online and configured for redundant 'fail safe' operation. We just lost our sr. systems admin in BOS and we don't currently have any sys admins with the experience or available time to start this project. We are looking into alternative solutions that are less resource intensive.\r\n\r\n+ BOS Lab 2 is nearing 90% physical space utilization and lab temperatures are above what is recommended for the lab environment. Eng-ops is looking into purchasing additional thermal sensors and cold air curtains to improve monitoring and cooling capabilites. [mdoyle] when will the looking into part be done, and the fixing of the problem part begin?\r\nThis project has already been started but could take 3-6 months based on: budget appropriation, equipment procurement lead times, curtain installation and tying all of the thermal sensors into a usefull monitoring utility. The lab temperatures aren't nearing critical levels so this project isn't urgent.\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops and Facilities conducted a thermal test in lab two over the weekend and found that we can reduce the lab temperatures by a few degrees when running all three chillers simultaneously. This isn't optimal but could serve as a fall back plan for us if lab temperatures begin to spike during the summer.\r\n\r\nLab monitoring planning and progress are being tracked through:\r\n(Planning: RT #101695)\r\n(Progress: RT #155669)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nMajor works completed. Try to deliver more than just point form. See the beaker example below for guidance.\r\n\r\n**Global Split**\r\n\r\n+ Usual stream of lab installation and issues handled.\r\n\r\n+ Hiring process began for JR lab admins in Boston, planning for other geos will be finalized shortly. Process still ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ pride.engineering.redhat.com was brought inline.\r\n\r\n+ maitai devel environment deployed on EAP6.\r\n\r\n+ Instance of \"Think Free\" application for case study deployed.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of zk-devel instance to bos for larger testing completed.\r\n\r\n+ Capex purchasing for NAY.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Cluster replacement hardware arrived on Tuesday, hopefully will have it up and running by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n+ Continued work on Jboss.org infrastructure issues definition. Waiting for approval in vault: https://vault-stage.englab.nay.redhat.com/Vault/showRequest/918\r\n\r\n+ Reviewed MWC documentation. Most important bits are there, however dlisnich has to document the services he spun up.\r\n\r\n+ Put together the requirements for the second sysadmin position.\r\n\r\n+ Had firsrt candidate that applied for the MW admin position. HR promised more by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Racked and configured critical Infiniband hardware for Gluster team (RHS).\r\n\r\n+ pasimon installed all systems he had in his queue prior to PTO\r\n\r\n+ TLV folks finished the installation and configuration of the HW in the new lab\r\n\r\n+ Discussed the expansion options in BRQ. Agreed that we'll reserve the place below the current lab for future expansion. Might move the HW completely out of this building if the 10.000 sq ft lab buildout gets approved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Coming Up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nwhat is happening, who will it affect and when is it  occuring. Llim likes the initiatives, he would like to provide dates so  people can anticipate the jobs coming up.\r\n\r\n####Global####\r\n\r\n+ Planning and deployment of Qpid, Globalsync and Alfresco hosts.\r\n\r\n+ RDU lab move planning (ongoing).\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ New storage infrastructure in NAY and globalsync v3 being brought online.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of NAY QE machines into Beaker\r\n\r\n+ Eng ops standard services (globalsync et.al) procurement and deployment into BLR.\r\n\r\n+ Start of recuritment for Brisbane BNE mid level admin position.\r\n\r\n+ Start of documentation relating to tools development process and eng-ops requirements for deployements.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Finish MWC documentation.\r\n\r\n+ Continue hiring process for the two positions (only one officially open yet).\r\n\r\n+ dpaz in RHCSA training next week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Strategic planning for BOS lab expansion is underway. Eng-ops to present a list of lab requirements to BOS expansion committee.\r\n\r\n+ Gluster storage (RHS) phase 2 order has been racked in lab 1.  The racks will be get network/power when the cage wall in lab 1 is taken down. The cage area will need modification before we can roll the racks into place. We're currently doing an infrastructure evaluation of the lab space for phase 2 and phase 3 this week. Once this is complete, I'll be able to provide an estimated completion date.\r\n\r\n+ TLV is getting one more floor, meaning one more lab. More space = good. ETA - not sooner than a few months to half a year.\r\n\r\n####USA####\r\n\r\n+ (2) new lab admins have started in Westford on June 4.\r\n\r\n+ (1) mid level candidate started June 20, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGeo leads: \r\n\r\nUSA - \"Matthew Schick\" <mschick@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nAPAC - \"Graeme Gillies\" <ggillies@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nEMEA - \"Vadim Grinco\" <vgrinco@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nLabs - \"Josh Nicolet\" <jnicolet@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nRAP - \"Ian Neilsen\" <ineilsen@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nSupplementary or supporting information or data.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever is put in this section will be visible in the online report but will not be sent out in the email version.\r\n\r\n", "author"=>"IanNeilsen", "web"=>"operations", "id"=>"IanNeilsen"}

We would like to remind Authors, that where possible include a link to the book and section, the revision of the guide, and a brief explaination of the change.\r\n\r\n## Review schedule ##\r\n\r\n| BU        | Product                | Books reviewed   | Review dates    | Review status |\r\n|:----------|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:----------------|:--------------|\r\n|Middleware | JBoss Data Grid 6.0    | 0/3              | July 2012       | Reviewing     |\r\n|Cloud      | RHEV 3.1               | 0/2              | 16 Jul - 17 Aug | Not started.  |\r\n|Platform   | RHEL 5.9               | ??               | 31 Jul - 04 Dec | Scoping.      |\r\n|Middleware | JBoss SOA 6.0          | 0/750 topics     | January 2013    | Scoping.      |\r\n|Platform   | RHEL 7.0               | ??               | January 2013    | Scoping.      |\r\n\r\n\r\n## Docs QE Test result ##\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\n\r\nNo documentation was reviewed last week, all Docs QE resources were tasked with bug verification.\r\n\r\n## Risks/Actions ##\r\n\r\n1. Docs QE noted that many of the bugs processed over the last week were commited directly to the live site without passing through the documentation workflow. By neglecting the defined workflow several guides are at risk: \r\n\r\n        * RHEL 6 Enterprise Identity Management Guide\r\n        \r\n        * RHEL 6 Deployment Guide\r\n        \r\n        * RHCS Administration Guide\r\n        \r\n        * RHCS CLI Tools Guide\r\n        \r\nThis represents a significant risk as any changes to these guides have effectively bypassed QE, one such guide was live with internal infrastructure references.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Work coming up ##\r\n\r\n+ JBoss Data Grid 6 - Getting Started Guide\r\n\r\n#### Feedback?\r\n\r\nIf you have any feedback regarding the format of this report or additional content you would like to see included, please contact <jskeoch@redhat.com>.\r\n", "author"=>"jskeoch", "web"=>"docsqe", "id"=>"mdoyle"}

We would like to remind Authors, that where possible include a link to the book and section, the revision of the guide, and a brief explanation of the change.\r\n\r\n## Review schedule ##\r\n\r\n| BU        | Product                | Books reviewed   | Review dates    | Review status |\r\n|:----------|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:----------------|:--------------|\r\n|Middleware | JBoss Data Grid 6.0    | 0/3              | July 2012       | Reviewing     |\r\n|Cloud      | RHEV 3.1               | 0/2              | 16 Jul - 17 Aug | Not started.  |\r\n|Platform   | RHEL 5.9               | ??               | 31 Jul - 04 Dec | Scoping.      |\r\n|Middleware | JBoss SOA 6.0          | 0/750 topics     | January 2013    | Scoping.      |\r\n|Platform   | RHEL 7.0               | ??               | January 2013    | Scoping.      |\r\n\r\n\r\n## Docs QE Test result ##\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\n\r\nNo documentation was reviewed last week, all Docs QE resources were tasked with bug verification.\r\n\r\n## Risks/Actions ##\r\n\r\n1. Docs QE noted that many of the bugs processed over the last week were committed directly to the live site without passing through the documentation workflow. By neglecting the defined workflow several guides are at risk: \r\n\r\n        * RHEL 6 Enterprise Identity Management Guide\r\n        \r\n        * RHEL 6 Deployment Guide\r\n        \r\n        * RHCS Administration Guide\r\n        \r\n        * RHCS CLI Tools Guide\r\n        \r\nThis represents a significant risk as any changes to these guides have effectively bypassed QE, one such guide was live with internal infrastructure references.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Work coming up ##\r\n\r\n+ JBoss Data Grid 6 - Getting Started Guide\r\n\r\n#### Feedback?\r\n\r\nIf you have any feedback regarding the format of this report or additional content you would like to see included, please contact <jskeoch@redhat.com>.\r\n", "author"=>"jskeoch", "web"=>"docsqe", "id"=>" \tDocs QE Weekly Executive Briefing - Week 27"}

We will keep the traffic running over Singapore.\r\n\r\n+ OpenShift outage notification\r\n    + Due to storms in the Virginia / North Caronlina regions there has been a power outage in the AWS facility.  From the amazon status web page: <http://status.aws.amazon.com/>\r\n\r\n**Completed Outages;**\r\n\r\n1] - need some notes about docs.jboss.org/author (confluence\r\n\r\n2] - TCMS, suffered an outage\r\n\r\n3] - BRQ storage cluster data loss\r\n     + backups migrated to a temporary storage.\r\n     + re-synced the rel-eng and nightly trees to prevent release delays.\r\n     + Data from /exports/jboss-qe (engineers homes) lost for ever.\r\n\r\n+ RDU,https://engineering.redhat.com/rt Scheduled Maintenance | June 21st\r\n    + Upgrading the system package. There will be a disruption in service.\r\n\r\n+ fbr.engineering.redhat.com/program Scheduled Maintenance | June 25\r\n    + Service \"program\" will be offline for a few minutes. Changing the location of the service from one server to another.\r\n\r\n+ beaker.engineering.redhat.com Scheduled Maintenance\r\n    + Beaker will be upgraded to the 0.9 release. This is a pretty significant release and will require database changes as well as the removal and replacement of cobbler with beaker-provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ Ongoing issues with TCMS application (3rd time for data loss). Still no resolution to cause of outage. Eng-Op looking into root cause.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Multiple issues in .org environment. Confluence application (http://docs.jboss.org/author) has been unstable for a few weeks. Root cause is still unknown, seeking feedback from JBoss team.\r\n\r\n+ See labs section\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon is on PTO since Thursday, leading to no installations being done in BRQ during next 2 weeks.\r\n\r\n+ TLV cooling issues are ongoing. \r\n\r\n    + Expert has been invited to propose solving the issue: covering gaps between servers was recommended and some machines are blowing hot air in the cold corridor.\r\n\r\n+ A new quote has been obtained regarding changing all racks and re-cabling the servers in lab-4 in TLV.\r\n\r\n+ beaker 0.9 upgrade completed. Not without issues but fortunately there were no major outages. No more cobbler on lab controllers.\r\n\r\n+ Dell Ops-util unit (responsible for BOS lab DNS and DHCP) is out of warranty. \r\n\r\n    + There are no backup units currently in place and any downtime on this unit will hold up critical BOS lab functions. We have already had to replace a CPU once. \r\n    + Eng-ops currently lacks the resources required to get the Ops-util replacement blades online.\r\n    + The replacement blades for this unit need to be brought online and configured for redundant 'fail safe' operation. \r\n    + We just lost our senior systems admin in BOS and currently do not have any sys admins with the experience or available time to start this project. We are looking into alternative solutions that are less resource intensive.\r\n\r\n+ BOS Lab 2 is nearing 90% physical space utilization and lab temperatures are above what is recommended for the lab environment. \r\n    + Eng-ops is looking into purchasing additional thermal sensors and cold air curtains to improve monitoring and cooling capabilities.\r\n    + This project has already been started but could take 3-6 months based on: budget appropriation, equipment procurement lead times, curtain installation and tying all of the thermal sensors into a useful monitoring utility. The lab temperatures aren't nearing critical levels so this project isn't urgent.\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops and Facilities conducted a thermal test in lab two over the weekend and found that we can reduce the lab temperatures by a few degrees when running all three chillers simultaneously. This isn't optimal but could serve as a fall back plan for us if lab temperatures begin to spike during the summer.\r\n\r\n+ Lab monitoring planning and progress is being tracked through:\r\n\r\n   + [Planning: RT #101695](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=101695)\r\n   + [Progress: RT #155669](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=155669)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n**Global Split**\r\n\r\n+ Usual stream of lab installation and issues handled.\r\n\r\n+ Hiring process began for JR lab admins in Boston, planning for other geos will be finalized shortly. Process still ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ pride.engineering.redhat.com was brought inline.\r\n\r\n+ maitai devel environment deployed on EAP6.\r\n\r\n+ Instance of \"Think Free\" application for case study deployed.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of zk-devel instance to BOS for larger testing completed.\r\n\r\n+ Capex purchasing for NAY.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Cluster replacement hardware arrived on Tuesday, hopefully will have it up and running by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n+ Reviewed MWC documentation. Critical information is present, however more documentation on services spun up is needed from dlisnich.\r\n\r\n+ Requirements for the second Sys Admin position have been put together.\r\n\r\n+ First candidate has applied for the MW admin position. People BU have promised more by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon installed all systems he had in his queue prior to PTO\r\n\r\n+ TLV folks finished the installation and configuration of the HW in the new lab\r\n\r\n+ Discussed the expansion options in BRQ. Agreed that we'll reserve the place below the current lab for future expansion. Might move the HW completely out of this building if the 10.000 sq ft lab build out gets approved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Coming Up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n####Global####\r\n\r\n+ Planning and deployment of Qpid, Globalsync and Alfresco hosts.\r\n\r\n+ RDU lab move planning (ongoing).\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ New storage infrastructure in NAY and globalsync v3 being brought online.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of NAY QE machines into Beaker.\r\n\r\n+ Eng ops standard services (globalsync et.al) procurement and deployment into BLR.\r\n\r\n+ Start of recruitment for Brisbane BNE mid-level Sys Admin position.\r\n\r\n+ Start of documentation relating to tools development process and eng-ops requirements for deployments.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Finish MWC (Middleware cluster) documentation.\r\n\r\n+ Continuing hiring process for the two positions. Only one position officially available at this time.\r\n\r\n+ dpaz in RHCSA training next week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Strategic planning for BOS lab expansion is under way. Eng-ops to present a list of lab requirements to BOS expansion committee.\r\n\r\n+ Gluster storage (RHS) phase 2 order has been racked in lab 1.  \r\n\r\n   + The racks will be get network/power when the cage wall in lab 1 is taken down. \r\n   + The cage area will need modification before we can roll the racks into place. \r\n   + We're currently doing an infrastructure evaluation of the lab space for phase 2 and phase 3 this week.\r\n   + Once this is complete, I'll be able to provide an estimated completion date.\r\n\r\n\r\n####USA####\r\n\r\n+ (2) new lab admins have started in Westford on June 4th.\r\n\r\n+ (1) mid level candidate started June 20th, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGeo leads: \r\n\r\nUSA - \"Matthew Schick\" <mschick@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nAPAC - \"Graeme Gillies\" <ggillies@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nEMEA - \"Vadim Grinco\" <vgrinco@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nLabs - \"Josh Nicolet\" <jnicolet@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nRAP - \"Ian Neilsen\" <ineilsen@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nSupplementary or supporting information or data.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever is put in this section will be visible in the online report but will not be sent out in the email version.\r\n\r\n", "author"=>"IanNeilsen", "web"=>"operations", "id"=>"IanNeilsen"}

Still no resolution to cause of outage. Eng-Op looking into root cause.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Multiple issues in .org environment. Confluence application (http://docs.jboss.org/author) has been unstable for a few weeks. Root cause is still unknown, seeking feedback from JBoss team.\r\n\r\n+ See labs section\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon is on PTO since Thursday, leading to no installations being done in BRQ during next 2 weeks.\r\n\r\n+ TLV cooling issues are ongoing. \r\n\r\n    + Expert has been invited to propose solving the issue: covering gaps between servers was recommended and some machines are blowing hot air in the cold corridor.\r\n\r\n+ A new quote has been obtained regarding changing all racks and re-cabling the servers in lab-4 in TLV.\r\n\r\n+ beaker 0.9 upgrade completed. Not without issues but fortunately there were no major outages. No more cobbler on lab controllers.\r\n\r\n+ Dell Ops-util unit (responsible for BOS lab DNS and DHCP) is out of warranty. \r\n\r\n    + There are no backup units currently in place and any downtime on this unit will hold up critical BOS lab functions. We have already had to replace a CPU once. \r\n    + Eng-ops currently lacks the resources required to get the Ops-util replacement blades online.\r\n    + The replacement blades for this unit need to be brought online and configured for redundant 'fail safe' operation. \r\n    + We just lost our senior systems admin in BOS and currently do not have any sys admins with the experience or available time to start this project. We are looking into alternative solutions that are less resource intensive.\r\n\r\n+ BOS Lab 2 is nearing 90% physical space utilization and lab temperatures are above what is recommended for the lab environment. \r\n\r\n    + Eng-ops is looking into purchasing additional thermal sensors and cold air curtains to improve monitoring and cooling capabilities.\r\n    + This project has already been started but could take 3-6 months based on: budget appropriation, equipment procurement lead times, curtain installation and tying all of the thermal sensors into a useful monitoring utility. The lab temperatures aren't nearing critical levels so this project isn't urgent.\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops and Facilities conducted a thermal test in lab two over the weekend and found that we can reduce the lab temperatures by a few degrees when running all three chillers simultaneously. This isn't optimal but could serve as a fall back plan for us if lab temperatures begin to spike during the summer.\r\n\r\n+ Lab monitoring planning and progress is being tracked through:\r\n\r\n   + [Planning: RT #101695](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=101695)\r\n   + [Progress: RT #155669](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=155669)\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n**Global Split**\r\n\r\n+ Usual stream of lab installation and issues handled.\r\n\r\n+ Hiring process began for JR lab admins in Boston, planning for other geos will be finalized shortly. Process still ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ pride.engineering.redhat.com was brought inline.\r\n\r\n+ maitai devel environment deployed on EAP6.\r\n\r\n+ Instance of \"Think Free\" application for case study deployed.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of zk-devel instance to BOS for larger testing completed.\r\n\r\n+ Capex purchasing for NAY.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Cluster replacement hardware arrived on Tuesday, hopefully will have it up and running by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n+ Reviewed MWC documentation. Critical information is present, however more documentation on services spun up is needed from dlisnich.\r\n\r\n+ Requirements for the second Sys Admin position have been put together.\r\n\r\n+ First candidate has applied for the MW admin position. People BU have promised more by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon installed all systems he had in his queue prior to PTO\r\n\r\n+ TLV folks finished the installation and configuration of the HW in the new lab\r\n\r\n+ Discussed the expansion options in BRQ. Agreed that we'll reserve the place below the current lab for future expansion. Might move the HW completely out of this building if the 10.000 sq ft lab build out gets approved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Coming Up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n####Global####\r\n\r\n+ Planning and deployment of Qpid, Globalsync and Alfresco hosts.\r\n\r\n+ RDU lab move planning (ongoing).\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ New storage infrastructure in NAY and globalsync v3 being brought online.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of NAY QE machines into Beaker.\r\n\r\n+ Eng ops standard services (globalsync et.al) procurement and deployment into BLR.\r\n\r\n+ Start of recruitment for Brisbane BNE mid-level Sys Admin position.\r\n\r\n+ Start of documentation relating to tools development process and eng-ops requirements for deployments.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Finish MWC (Middleware cluster) documentation.\r\n\r\n+ Continuing hiring process for the two positions. Only one position officially available at this time.\r\n\r\n+ dpaz in RHCSA training next week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Strategic planning for BOS lab expansion is under way. Eng-ops to present a list of lab requirements to BOS expansion committee.\r\n\r\n+ Gluster storage (RHS) phase 2 order has been racked in lab 1.  \r\n\r\n   + The racks will be get network/power when the cage wall in lab 1 is taken down. \r\n   + The cage area will need modification before we can roll the racks into place. \r\n   + We're currently doing an infrastructure evaluation of the lab space for phase 2 and phase 3 this week.\r\n   + Once this is complete, I'll be able to provide an estimated completion date.\r\n\r\n\r\n####USA####\r\n\r\n+ (2) new lab admins have started in Westford on June 4th.\r\n\r\n+ (1) mid level candidate started June 20th, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGeo leads: \r\n\r\nUSA - \"Matthew Schick\" <mschick@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nAPAC - \"Graeme Gillies\" <ggillies@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nEMEA - \"Vadim Grinco\" <vgrinco@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nLabs - \"Josh Nicolet\" <jnicolet@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nRAP - \"Ian Neilsen\" <ineilsen@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nSupplementary or supporting information or data.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever is put in this section will be visible in the online report but will not be sent out in the email version.\r\n\r\n", "author"=>"IanNeilsen", "web"=>"operations", "id"=>"Operations Weekly Executive Briefing - Week 27"}

We will keep the traffic running over Singapore.\r\n\r\n+ OpenShift outage notification\r\n\r\n   + Due to storms in the Virginia / North Caronlina regions there has been a power outage in the AWS facility.  From the amazon status web page: <http://status.aws.amazon.com/>\r\n\r\n**Completed Outages;**\r\n\r\n1] - Confluence docs.jboss.org/author suffered an outage.

This is a pretty significant release and will require database changes as well as the removal and replacement of cobbler with beaker-provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ Ongoing issues with TCMS application (3rd time for data loss). Still no resolution to cause of outage. Eng-Op looking into root cause.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Multiple issues in .org environment. Confluence application (http://docs.jboss.org/author) has been unstable for a few weeks. Root cause is still unknown, seeking feedback from JBoss team.\r\n\r\n+ See labs section\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon is on PTO since Thursday, leading to no installations being done in BRQ during next 2 weeks.\r\n\r\n+ TLV cooling issues are ongoing. \r\n\r\n   + Expert has been invited to propose solving the issue: covering gaps between servers was recommended and some machines are blowing hot air in the cold corridor.\r\n\r\n+ A new quote has been obtained regarding changing all racks and re-cabling the servers in lab-4 in TLV.\r\n\r\n+ beaker 0.9 upgrade completed. Not without issues but fortunately there were no major outages. No more cobbler on lab controllers.\r\n\r\n+ Dell Ops-util unit (responsible for BOS lab DNS and DHCP) is out of warranty. \r\n\r\n   + There are no backup units currently in place and any downtime on this unit will hold up critical BOS lab functions. We have already had to replace a CPU once. \r\n\r\n   + Eng-ops currently lacks the resources required to get the Ops-util replacement blades online.\r\n\r\n   + The replacement blades for this unit need to be brought online and configured for redundant 'fail safe' operation. \r\n\r\n   + We just lost our senior systems admin in BOS and currently do not have any sys admins with the experience or available time to start this project. We are looking into alternative solutions that are less resource intensive.\r\n\r\n+ BOS Lab 2 is nearing 90% physical space utilization and lab temperatures are above what is recommended for the lab environment. \r\n\r\n   + Eng-ops is looking into purchasing additional thermal sensors and cold air curtains to improve monitoring and cooling capabilities.\r\n\r\n   + This project has already been started but could take 3-6 months based on: budget appropriation, equipment procurement lead times, curtain installation and tying all of the thermal sensors into a useful monitoring utility. The lab temperatures aren't nearing critical levels so this project isn't urgent.\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops and Facilities conducted a thermal test in lab two over the weekend and found that we can reduce the lab temperatures by a few degrees when running all three chillers simultaneously. This isn't optimal but could serve as a fall back plan for us if lab temperatures begin to spike during the summer.\r\n\r\n+ Lab monitoring planning and progress is being tracked through:\r\n\r\n   + [Planning: RT #101695](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=101695)\r\n\r\n   + [Progress: RT #155669](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=155669)\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n**Global Split**\r\n\r\n+ Usual stream of lab installation and issues handled.\r\n\r\n+ Hiring process began for JR lab admins in Boston, planning for other geos will be finalized shortly. Process still ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ pride.engineering.redhat.com was brought inline.\r\n\r\n+ maitai devel environment deployed on EAP6.\r\n\r\n+ Instance of \"Think Free\" application for case study deployed.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of zk-devel instance to BOS for larger testing completed.\r\n\r\n+ Capex purchasing for NAY.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Cluster replacement hardware arrived on Tuesday, hopefully will have it up and running by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n+ Reviewed MWC documentation. Critical information is present, however more documentation on services spun up is needed from dlisnich.\r\n\r\n+ Requirements for the second Sys Admin position have been put together.\r\n\r\n+ First candidate has applied for the MW admin position. People BU have promised more by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon installed all systems he had in his queue prior to PTO\r\n\r\n+ TLV folks finished the installation and configuration of the HW in the new lab\r\n\r\n+ Discussed the expansion options in BRQ. Agreed that we'll reserve the place below the current lab for future expansion. Might move the HW completely out of this building if the 10.000 sq ft lab build out gets approved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Coming Up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n####Global####\r\n\r\n+ Planning and deployment of Qpid, Globalsync and Alfresco hosts.\r\n\r\n+ RDU lab move planning (ongoing).\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ New storage infrastructure in NAY and globalsync v3 being brought online.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of NAY QE machines into Beaker.\r\n\r\n+ Eng ops standard services (globalsync et.al) procurement and deployment into BLR.\r\n\r\n+ Start of recruitment for Brisbane BNE mid-level Sys Admin position.\r\n\r\n+ Start of documentation relating to tools development process and eng-ops requirements for deployments.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Finish MWC (Middleware cluster) documentation.\r\n\r\n+ Continuing hiring process for the two positions.

We have a ticket opened w/ vendor. \r\n\r\n   + Update - Our service provider found the issue, and they need to test the circuit, so we will switch the traffic over to SIN2 again at 10:30.\r\n\r\n   + Update the local carrier need to access MDF, but he cannot b/c out of business hours, they will work on it again on Monday. We will keep the traffic running over Singapore.\r\n\r\n+ OpenShift outage notification\r\n\r\n   + Due to storms in the Virginia / North Caronlina regions there has been a power outage in the AWS facility.  From the amazon status web page: <http://status.aws.amazon.com/>\r\n\r\n**Completed Outages;**\r\n\r\n1. Confluence docs.jboss.org/author suffered an outage. Issue is being identified.\r\n\r\n2. TCMS, suffered an outage\r\n\r\n3. BRQ storage cluster data loss\r\n\r\n   + backups migrated to a temporary storage.\r\n\r\n      + re-synced the rel-eng and nightly trees to prevent release delays.\r\n\r\n      + Data from /exports/jboss-qe (engineers homes) lost for ever.\r\n\r\n4. RDU,https://engineering.redhat.com/rt Scheduled Maintenance | June 21st\r\n\r\n   + Upgrading the system package. There will be a disruption in service.\r\n\r\n5. fbr.engineering.redhat.com/program Scheduled Maintenance | June 25\r\n\r\n   + Service \"program\" will be offline for a few minutes. Changing the location of the service from one server to another.\r\n\r\n6. beaker.engineering.redhat.com Scheduled Maintenance\r\n\r\n   + Beaker will be upgraded to the 0.9 release. This is a pretty significant release and will require database changes as well as the removal and replacement of cobbler with beaker-provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ Ongoing issues with TCMS application (3rd time for data loss). Still no resolution to cause of outage. Eng-Op looking into root cause.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Multiple issues in .org environment. Confluence application (http://docs.jboss.org/author) has been unstable for a few weeks. Root cause is still unknown, seeking feedback from JBoss team.\r\n\r\n+ See labs section\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon is on PTO since Thursday, leading to no installations being done in BRQ during next 2 weeks.\r\n\r\n+ TLV cooling issues are ongoing. \r\n\r\n   + Expert has been invited to propose solving the issue: covering gaps between servers was recommended and some machines are blowing hot air in the cold corridor.\r\n\r\n+ A new quote has been obtained regarding changing all racks and re-cabling the servers in lab-4 in TLV.\r\n\r\n+ beaker 0.9 upgrade completed. Not without issues but fortunately there were no major outages. No more cobbler on lab controllers.\r\n\r\n+ Dell Ops-util unit (responsible for BOS lab DNS and DHCP) is out of warranty. \r\n\r\n   + There are no backup units currently in place and any downtime on this unit will hold up critical BOS lab functions. We have already had to replace a CPU once. \r\n\r\n   + Eng-ops currently lacks the resources required to get the Ops-util replacement blades online.\r\n\r\n   + The replacement blades for this unit need to be brought online and configured for redundant 'fail safe' operation. \r\n\r\n   + We just lost our senior systems admin in BOS and currently do not have any sys admins with the experience or available time to start this project. We are looking into alternative solutions that are less resource intensive.\r\n\r\n+ BOS Lab 2 is nearing 90% physical space utilization and lab temperatures are above what is recommended for the lab environment. \r\n\r\n   + Eng-ops is looking into purchasing additional thermal sensors and cold air curtains to improve monitoring and cooling capabilities.\r\n\r\n   + This project has already been started but could take 3-6 months based on: budget appropriation, equipment procurement lead times, curtain installation and tying all of the thermal sensors into a useful monitoring utility. The lab temperatures aren't nearing critical levels so this project isn't urgent.\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops and Facilities conducted a thermal test in lab two over the weekend and found that we can reduce the lab temperatures by a few degrees when running all three chillers simultaneously. This isn't optimal but could serve as a fall back plan for us if lab temperatures begin to spike during the summer.\r\n\r\n+ Lab monitoring planning and progress is being tracked through:\r\n\r\n   + [Planning: RT #101695](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=101695)\r\n\r\n   + [Progress: RT #155669](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=155669)\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n**Global Split**\r\n\r\n+ Usual stream of lab installation and issues handled.\r\n\r\n+ Hiring process began for JR lab admins in Boston, planning for other geos will be finalized shortly. Process still ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ pride.engineering.redhat.com was brought inline.\r\n\r\n+ maitai devel environment deployed on EAP6.\r\n\r\n+ Instance of \"Think Free\" application for case study deployed.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of zk-devel instance to BOS for larger testing completed.\r\n\r\n+ Capex purchasing for NAY.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Cluster replacement hardware arrived on Tuesday, hopefully will have it up and running by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n+ Reviewed MWC documentation. Critical information is present, however more documentation on services spun up is needed from dlisnich.\r\n\r\n+ Requirements for the second Sys Admin position have been put together.\r\n\r\n+ First candidate has applied for the MW admin position. People BU have promised more by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon installed all systems he had in his queue prior to PTO\r\n\r\n+ TLV folks finished the installation and configuration of the HW in the new lab\r\n\r\n+ Discussed the expansion options in BRQ. Agreed that we'll reserve the place below the current lab for future expansion. Might move the HW completely out of this building if the 10.000 sq ft lab build out gets approved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Coming Up\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n####Global####\r\n\r\n+ Planning and deployment of Qpid, Globalsync and Alfresco hosts.\r\n\r\n+ RDU lab move planning (ongoing).\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ New storage infrastructure in NAY and globalsync v3 being brought online.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of NAY QE machines into Beaker.\r\n\r\n+ Eng ops standard services (globalsync et.al) procurement and deployment into BLR.\r\n\r\n+ Start of recruitment for Brisbane BNE mid-level Sys Admin position.\r\n\r\n+ Start of documentation relating to tools development process and eng-ops requirements for deployments.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Finish MWC (Middleware cluster) documentation.\r\n\r\n+ Continuing hiring process for the two positions. Only one position officially available at this time.\r\n\r\n+ dpaz in RHCSA training next week.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ Strategic planning for BOS lab expansion is under way. Eng-ops to present a list of lab requirements to BOS expansion committee.\r\n\r\n+ Gluster storage (RHS) phase 2 order has been racked in lab 1.  \r\n\r\n   + The racks will be get network/power when the cage wall in lab 1 is taken down. \r\n\r\n   + The cage area will need modification before we can roll the racks into place. \r\n\r\n   + We're currently doing an infrastructure evaluation of the lab space for phase 2 and phase 3 this week.\r\n\r\n   + Once this is complete, I'll be able to provide an estimated completion date.\r\n\r\n\r\n####USA####\r\n\r\n+ (2) new lab admins have started in Westford on June 4th.\r\n\r\n+ (1) mid level candidate started June 20th, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGeo leads: \r\n\r\nUSA - \"Matthew Schick\" <mschick@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nAPAC - \"Graeme Gillies\" <ggillies@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nEMEA - \"Vadim Grinco\" <vgrinco@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nLabs - \"Josh Nicolet\" <jnicolet@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nRAP - \"Ian Neilsen\" <ineilsen@redhat.com>\r\n\r\nSupplementary or supporting information or data.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever is put in this section will be visible in the online report but will not be sent out in the email version.\r\n\r\n", "author"=>"IanNeilsen", "web"=>"operations", "id"=>"Operations Weekly Executive Briefing - Week 27"}

We have a ticket opened w/ vendor. \r\n\r\n   + Update - Our service provider found the issue, and they need to test the circuit, so we will switch the traffic over to SIN2 again at 10:30.\r\n\r\n   + Update the local carrier need to access MDF, but he cannot b/c out of business hours, they will work on it again on Monday. We will keep the traffic running over Singapore.\r\n\r\n+ OpenShift outage notification\r\n\r\n   + Due to storms in the Virginia / North Carolina regions there has been a power outage in the AWS facility.  From the Amazon status web page: <http://status.aws.amazon.com/>\r\n\r\n**Completed Outages;**\r\n\r\n1. Confluence docs.jboss.org/author suffered an outage. Issue is being identified.\r\n\r\n2. TCMS, suffered an outage\r\n\r\n3. BRQ storage cluster data loss\r\n\r\n   + backups migrated to a temporary storage.\r\n\r\n      + re-synced the rel-eng and nightly trees to prevent release delays.\r\n\r\n      + Data from /exports/jboss-qe (engineers homes) lost for ever.\r\n\r\n4. RDU,https://engineering.redhat.com/rt Scheduled Maintenance | June 21st\r\n\r\n   + Upgrading the system package. There will be a disruption in service.\r\n\r\n5. fbr.engineering.redhat.com/program Scheduled Maintenance | June 25\r\n\r\n   + Service \"program\" will be offline for a few minutes. Changing the location of the service from one server to another.\r\n\r\n6. beaker.engineering.redhat.com Scheduled Maintenance\r\n\r\n   + Beaker will be upgraded to the 0.9 release. This is a pretty significant release and will require database changes as well as the removal and replacement of cobbler with beaker-provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRisks/Actions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ Ongoing issues with TCMS application (3rd time for data loss). Still no resolution to cause of outage. Eng-Op looking into root cause.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Multiple issues in .org environment. Confluence application (http://docs.jboss.org/author) has been unstable for a few weeks. Root cause is still unknown, seeking feedback from JBoss team.\r\n\r\n+ See labs section\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon is on PTO since Thursday, leading to no installations being done in BRQ during next 2 weeks.\r\n\r\n+ TLV cooling issues are ongoing. \r\n\r\n   + Expert has been invited to propose solving the issue: covering gaps between servers was recommended and some machines are blowing hot air in the cold corridor.\r\n\r\n+ A new quote has been obtained regarding changing all racks and re-cabling the servers in lab-4 in TLV.\r\n\r\n+ beaker 0.9 upgrade completed. Not without issues but fortunately there were no major outages. No more cobbler on lab controllers.\r\n\r\n+ Dell Ops-util unit (responsible for BOS lab DNS and DHCP) is out of warranty. \r\n\r\n   + There are no backup units currently in place and any downtime on this unit will hold up critical BOS lab functions. We have already had to replace a CPU once. \r\n\r\n   + Eng-ops currently lacks the resources required to get the Ops-util replacement blades online.\r\n\r\n   + The replacement blades for this unit need to be brought online and configured for redundant 'fail safe' operation. \r\n\r\n   + We just lost our senior systems admin in BOS and currently do not have any sys admins with the experience or available time to start this project. We are looking into alternative solutions that are less resource intensive.\r\n\r\n+ BOS Lab 2 is nearing 90% physical space utilization and lab temperatures are above what is recommended for the lab environment. \r\n\r\n   + Eng-ops is looking into purchasing additional thermal sensors and cold air curtains to improve monitoring and cooling capabilities.\r\n\r\n   + This project has already been started but could take 3-6 months based on: budget appropriation, equipment procurement lead times, curtain installation and tying all of the thermal sensors into a useful monitoring utility. The lab temperatures aren't nearing critical levels so this project isn't urgent.\r\n\r\n+ Eng-Ops and Facilities conducted a thermal test in lab two over the weekend and found that we can reduce the lab temperatures by a few degrees when running all three chillers simultaneously. This isn't optimal but could serve as a fall back plan for us if lab temperatures begin to spike during the summer.\r\n\r\n+ Lab monitoring planning and progress is being tracked through:\r\n\r\n   + [Planning: RT #101695](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=101695)\r\n\r\n   + [Progress: RT #155669](https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=155669)\r\n\r\nWork Completed\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n**Global Split**\r\n\r\n+ Usual stream of lab installation and issues handled.\r\n\r\n+ Hiring process began for JR lab admins in Boston, planning for other geos will be finalized shortly. Process still ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n####APAC####\r\n\r\n+ pride.engineering.redhat.com was brought inline.\r\n\r\n+ maitai devel environment deployed on EAP6.\r\n\r\n+ Instance of \"Think Free\" application for case study deployed.\r\n\r\n+ Migration of zk-devel instance to BOS for larger testing completed.\r\n\r\n+ Capex purchasing for NAY.\r\n\r\n####EMEA####\r\n\r\n+ Cluster replacement hardware arrived on Tuesday, hopefully will have it up and running by the end of the week.\r\n\r\n+ Reviewed MWC documentation. Critical information is present, however more documentation on services spun up is needed from dlisnich.\r\n\r\n####LABS####\r\n\r\n+ pasimon installed all systems he had in his queue prior to PTO\r\n\r\n+ TLV folks finished the installation and configuration of the HW in the new lab\r\n\r\n+ Discussed the expansion options in BRQ. Agreed that we'll reserve the place below the current lab for future expansion.
